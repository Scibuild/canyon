Another Christmas, another half baked programming language!

Statically typed as always, but the type inference needs some work...

Looking forward to adding
- [ ] methods
- [ ] interfaces
- [ ] options/errors
- [ ] coroutines 
- [ ] libraries
- [ ] the ability to interface with Lua code


Compiles to Lua so garbage collection for free ðŸ˜Œ
